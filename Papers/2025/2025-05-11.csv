10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-68d6w,DENSE SENSE : A novel approach utilizing an electron density augmented machine learning paradigm to understand a complex odour landscape ,"Olfaction is a complex process which involves interaction of multiple odour receptors in nasal epithelium to produce the sensation of smell for particular odorant molecules. Elucidating structure-activity-relationships for odorants and their receptors remains difficult since crystallization of the odour receptors extremely difficult. Therefore, ligand-based approaches that leverage machine learning remain the state of the art for predicting odorant properties for molecules, such as the graph neural network approach used by. In this paper we explore how information from Quantum Mechanics (QM) could synergistically improve the results obtained with the graph neural network. Our findings underscore the possibility of this methodology in predicting odour perception directly from QM data, offering a novel approach in the Machine learning space to understand olfaction.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-05-07T10:54:26.717Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6816864c927d1c2e66e3a996/original/dense-sense-a-novel-approach-utilizing-an-electron-density-augmented-machine-learning-paradigm-to-understand-a-complex-odour-landscape.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-tg9rn,Accelerated Development of Energy Materials through Automation and Artificial Intelligence,"Batteries, fuel cells, and electrolyzers mostly rely on advances in solid-state inorganic materials, yet discovering and optimizing these materials remains a complex and time-intensive challenge. Self-driving laboratories (SDLs), through advances in computation, automation and artificial intelligence (AI), are revolutionizing the pace of solid-state material discovery. SDLs can rapidly navigate vast chemical spaces, optimizing multi-dimensional synthesis and processing conditions and accelerating the identification of high-performance materials relevant for commercialization. The approach not only enhances efficiency and experimental precision but also mitigates the trial-and-error limitations of traditional methods. In this perspective, we examine how computation, high throughput automation, and advanced AI techniques can accelerate the discovery of energy materials, highlighting key capabilities, current applications, and providing a perspective on future directions in the field. We will also discuss how despite challenges such as high implementation costs and the complexity of automating solid-state synthesis, the continued success of SDLs relies on more democratized, accessible, and collaborative frameworks.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Energy; Artificial Intelligence; Energy Storage; Fuels - Energy Science; Materials Chemistry,2025-05-06T12:51:58.504Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68164b07e561f77ed4eae2d2/original/accelerated-development-of-energy-materials-through-automation-and-artificial-intelligence.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-kp25m,The Artificial Intelligence Guided Search for New CHIPs Comonomers,"Chalcogenide Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Polymers (CHIPs) have the potential to revolutionize infrared (IR) optics and create sustainable and recyclable devices. CHIPs combine elemental sulfur with organic comonomers via inverse vulcanization to create a high-sulfur content polymer, with a refractive index and IR transparency that rival state of the art inorganic solids, while preserving the processability and recyclability of plastic materials. However, the optimal comonomer for these applications remains unknown. This manuscript presents a gradient boosted tree model that determines which comonomers merit further consideration as high-performing CHIPs materials. After training models on previously calculated IR-absorption data we apply them to a set of 960,934 molecules from the GDB dataset and validate the predictions for both highly transparent molecules and a set of one thousand randomly selected molecules. Finally, we compare their optical properties in the gas phase and in an approximation of a CHIPs motif by replacing their double bonds with elemental sulfur rings.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-93qp3-v2,Organic Solubility Prediction at the Limit of Aleatoric Uncertainty,"Small molecule solubility is a critically important property which affects the efficiency, environmental impact, and phase behavior of synthetic processes. Experimental determination of solubility is a time- and resource-intensive process and existing methods for in silico estimation of solubility are limited by their generality, speed, and accuracy. This work presents two models derived from the fastprop and chemprop architectures and trained on BigSolDB which are capable of predicting solubility at arbitrary temperatures for any small molecule in organic solvent. Both extrapolate to unseen solutes 2-3 times more accurately than the current state-of-the-art model and we demonstrate that they are approaching the aleatoric limit (0.5-1 logS), suggesting that further improvements in prediction accuracy require more accurate datasets. These models, collectively referred to as fastsolv, are open source, freely accessible via a Python package and web interface, highly reproducible, and up to 50 times faster than the next best alternative.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-05-09T09:00:08.752Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information ', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/681a36fa927d1c2e663f5fe8/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/681a35ed50018ac7c5a74148/original/organic-solubility-prediction-at-the-limit-of-aleatoric-uncertainty.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-w1nc5-v2,Modelling and estimation of chemical reaction yields from high-throughput experiments,"Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are transforming the way chemical reactions are studied today. Valuable datasets from high-throughput experimentation (HTE) are increasingly being generated to better understand reaction conditions that are crucial for outcomes such as yields and selectivities. However, it is often overlooked that data from such designed experiments possess a very specific structure, which can be captured by appropriate statistical models. Ignoring these underlying data structures when applying ML/AI algorithms can result in completely misleading conclusions. In contrast, leveraging knowledge about the data-generating process together with suitable estimation approaches yields reliable, interpretable, and comprehensive insights into the chemical reaction mechanisms. A particularly complex dataset is available for the Buchwald-Hartwig amination. Using this dataset, an appropriate statistical model for HTE-generated chemical data is introduced, and a suitable parameter estimation algorithm is developed. Based on the estimated model, new insights into the Buchwald-Hartwig amination are thoroughly discussed. Our approach is directly applicable to a wide range of HTE-generated data for chemical reactions and beyond",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Machine Learning,2025-05-07T08:38:18.804Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary material for Modelling and estimation of chemical reaction yields from high-throughput experiments', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6818bb8ae561f77ed42277a3/original/supplementary-material-for-modelling-and-estimation-of-chemical-reaction-yields-from-high-throughput-experiments.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6818bb8ae561f77ed4227799/original/modelling-and-estimation-of-chemical-reaction-yields-from-high-throughput-experiments.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-mc5q4,Combining Physics-Based Protein–DNA Energetics with Machine Learning to Predict Interpretable Transcription Factor-DNA Binding,"Transcription factors (TFs) are essential regulators of gene expression, and variations in their target DNA sequences due to altering TF-DNA binding affinity and specificity lead to diseases ranging from developmental disorders to cancer. Computational methods that integrate physics-based models with machine learning (ML) hold promise to accurately predict protein–DNA binding affinities while ensuring interpretability and generalizability. Here, we present an approach combining all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area (MMGBSA) energy calculations with ML model constructions (neural networks, random forests, support vector machines) to predict DNA binding affinities and specificities for the dimeric TF Myc/Max. Using high-quality experimental data from genomic-context protein-binding microarrays (gcPBM), we constructed a balanced dataset of 168 DNA sequences reflecting physiologically relevant genomic environments. Multiple independent simulations were conducted per sequence for each TF-DNA complex to capture structural dynamic and interaction properties, with physically essential energetic descriptors extracted, including van der Waals, electrostatic, solvation, hydrogen bonding, and additional energy corrections. Our models achieved a Pearson correlation of ~0.73 and a mean absolute error of 0.4, substantially improving upon conventional MMGBSA prediction. Feature importance analyses highlighted TF-DNA interfacial complementarity and hydrophobic interactions as primary determinants of binding affinity and specificity, though TF-DNA interfacial hydrogen bonding contributions remain to be better characterized physically for sequence dependency. This physics-informed ML framework thus aims at both predictive accuracy and mechanistic interpretability, paving the way toward universal scalable prediction of interpretable protein–DNA interactions.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence,2025-05-07T07:08:14.261Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Material', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/681681a8e561f77ed4f2e24d/original/supplementary-material.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6816805350018ac7c54c4d62/original/combining-physics-based-protein-dna-energetics-with-machine-learning-to-predict-interpretable-transcription-factor-dna-binding.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0ln4g-v3, Kinetic predictions for SN2 reactions using the BERT architecture: Comparison and interpretation.,"The accurate prediction of reaction rates is an integral step in elucidating reaction mechanisms and designing synthetic pathways. Traditionally, kinetic parameters have been derived from activation energies obtained from quantum mechanical (QM) methods and, more recently, machine learning (ML) approaches. Among ML methods, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a type of transformer-based model, is the state-of-the-art method for both reaction classification and yield prediction. Despite its success, it has yet to be applied to kinetic prediction. In this work, we train a BERT model to predict experimental logk values of SN2 reactions and compare its performance to the top-performing Random Forest (RF) literature model in terms of accuracy, training time, and ability to replicate known reactivity rules. Both BERT and RF models exhibit near-experimental accuracy (RMSE = 1.1 logk units) on similarity-split test data. Interpretation of the predictions from both BERT and RF reveal that both models identify key reaction centers, as well as known electronic and steric effects. However, limitations in logk extrapolation and recognition of aromatic effects are found for the RF and BERT models, respectively.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Organic Synthesis and Reactions; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-05-06T06:51:55.229Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information.', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/681633f150018ac7c5417590/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/681633f050018ac7c5417580/original/kinetic-predictions-for-sn2-reactions-using-the-bert-architecture-comparison-and-interpretation.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-3v3gw-v3,       An Efficient Machine Learning-Based Prediction Model for JAK2 Inhibitor pIC50,"Background: Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) is a key kinase in cellular signal transduction. Its abnormal activation is closely related to various myeloproliferative neoplasms and inflammatory diseases. Developing selective JAK2 inhibitors is an important direction in drug discovery. Accurate prediction of compound inhibitory activity (pIC50) against JAK2 is crucial for accelerating the discovery and optimization of lead compounds. Objective: This study aims to utilize public resources from the ChEMBL database, combined with machine learning methods, to build a computational model capable of efficiently and accurately predicting the pIC50 values of JAK2 inhibitors. Methods: We collected compounds targeting human JAK2 (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL2971) and their IC50 (nM) activity data from the ChEMBL database. After data cleaning (retaining only precise values with standard_relation = '=') and standardization (converting IC50 to pIC50, retaining the average pIC50 for duplicate compounds), a dataset containing 5546 compounds was finally obtained. RDKit (version 2022.9.5) was used to calculate Morgan fingerprints (radius=2, 2048 bits), MACCS Keys fingerprints (167 bits), and 13 physicochemical and topological descriptors. Based on feature importance calculated during the data processing phase (derived from preliminary model evaluation), the top 350 features were selected. However, due to the absence of some features in the current dataset, the final model used 345 features. The dataset was randomly split into training (n=4436) and test sets (n=1110) at an 80:20 ratio. The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting, version 3.0.0) algorithm was used to build the prediction model, and hyperparameters (learning_rate, max_depth, subsample, colsample_bytree, gamma, reg_alpha, reg_lambda) were optimized using 5-fold cross-validation and GridSearchCV. An early stopping strategy was employed during the final model training to prevent overfitting. Results: After hyperparameter optimization, the final XGBoost model demonstrated good predictive performance on the independent test set, achieving a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.7184, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.5968, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.4593. Performance metrics on the training set (R²=0.8978) also indicated a good model fit, and the gap between training and test set performance was within an acceptable range, suggesting that overfitting was effectively controlled. Conclusion: This study successfully constructed an XGBoost-based prediction model for JAK2 inhibitor pIC50. Utilizing easily accessible molecular descriptors, the model demonstrated high prediction accuracy and robustness on an external test set. This model holds promise as an efficient virtual screening tool to aid the early discovery and optimization process of JAK2 inhibitors.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery Systems; Machine Learning; Chemoinformatics - Computational Chemistry,2025-05-06T06:24:01.030Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/681490d650018ac7c51a0b8f/original/an-efficient-machine-learning-based-prediction-model-for-jak2-inhibitor-p-ic50.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-ds2pb,MLMD: Machine Learning Velocities to Propagate Molecular Dynamics Simulations,"Temporal evolution in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations requires updates on particle velocities. These updates are obtained from forces that are computed traditionally from physics-based Hamiltonians, and more recently from machine-learned (ML) numerical forms. An alternative strategy that is being explored is to predict velocity updates from ML models without concerning with energy or force calculations. The key advantages of this strategy are that bypassing force calculations, especially when dealing with quantum mechanical Hamiltonians, should effectively speed up MD simulations, and such ML predictors can also be trained on the fly. Here we take this development to the next stage by showing how ML velocity predictors can be incorporated into MD integrators to propagate trajectories accurately. In addition, we explore a new type of ML velocity predictor that is trained exclusively on historical particle velocities, where we exploit the fact that particle velocities are inherently auto-correlated in time. We show how stacked long short-term memory neural networks can be trained to accomplish these tasks and propagate trajectories that conserve energy, structure and dynamics. The fascinating aspect is that structure and energies are conserved without actually predicting them directly. Trajectories do tend to accumulate errors upon continual use of ML velocity predictions, despite velocity prediction accuracy being greater than 99.9%. Nevertheless, we show that error accumulation can be controlled and MD stability can be rescued by making periodic injections of velocity updates computed from Hamiltonians (frequency ≤ 0.01). We propose this proof-of-concept machine-learned MD (MLMD) protocol using a series of harmonic oscillators, laying the foundation necessary to extending its applications to complex systems.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Machine Learning,2025-05-05T08:25:26.461Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information for ""MLMD: Machine Learning Velocities to Propagate Molecular Dynamics Simulations""', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6812d89f50018ac7c5e667b6/original/supporting-information-for-mlmd-machine-learning-velocities-to-propagate-molecular-dynamics-simulations.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6812d384927d1c2e667d0097/original/mlmd-machine-learning-velocities-to-propagate-molecular-dynamics-simulations.pdf

The necessary tricks are well understood when using force fields. Over the past few years, neural network potentials (NNPs) have seen rapid development. Their potentially higher accuracy compared to force fields makes them attractive for use in FES. Here, we outline a method for gradually decoupling atoms and molecules in systems that are fully described by NNPs. Specifically, we show that manipulating the neighbor list is equivalent to using soft-core potentials in force-field-based FES. Since constructing the neighbor list is a central step, regardless of the NNP's inner workings, our approach is agnostic to NNP architecture. We validate the correctness of our methodology by demonstrating cycle closure for a model problem and report solvation free energies obtained with the MACE-OFF23(S/M) NNP.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Machine Learning,2025-05-05T08:15:22.083Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6812638f50018ac7c5da3dd1/original/architecture-independent-absolute-solvation-free-energy-calculations-with-neural-network-potentials.pdf

Targeting CFIXa offers a promising therapeutic strategy, balancing anticoagulation efficacy with reduced bleeding risk. This study investigates guava (Psidium guajava) leaf-derived bioactive compounds: 4-Androstene-3.α.,17.β.-diol (Compound 2), Methenolone acetate (Compound 3), and Amitriptyline-M-(CH₃)₂NOH AC (Compound 7) as potential CFIXa inhibitors through MDS, binding free energy calculations, and cluster network analysis. Compound 7 demonstrated superior stability, with the lowest RMSD (0.347 ± 0.110 nm) and strongest binding affinity (−15.475 ± 3.173 kcal/mol), driven by key interactions with residues H:ASN97 [264] (2.9–3.1 Å H-bond), H:TYR99 [266] (4.7–5.2 Å π-alkyl), and H:PHE174 [342] (4.8–5.3 Å π-alkyl) in the S2/S4 pockets. Cluster analysis revealed 40 conformational states, with Cluster 1 (15.8% occupancy) dominating due to these stable interactions. Compound 2 showed moderate stability (RMSD: 0.459 ± 0.307 nm; ΔG: −10.132 ± 4.414 kcal/mol), anchored by hydrophobic contacts with H:LYS239 [409] (4.40–5.17 Å) and L:PHE98 [98] (2.62 Å H-bond), but exhibited dynamic transitions between 49 clusters. Compound 3 was the least stable (RMSD: 0.965 ± 0.382 nm; ΔG: −9.541 ± 4.115 kcal/mol), with 74 clusters and frequent unbinding events (e.g., Cluster 24, 100% dissociation). Transition networks highlighted Compound 7’s kinetic robustness, with >97% of transitions occurring between stable, ligand-bound clusters (e.g., Cluster 1 ↔ Cluster 9). In contrast, Compound 3’s Markov model showed 96.3% self-transitions in unbound clusters, indicating poor residence time and kinetic trapping. Energy decomposition identified H:TYR99 [266] and H:PHE174 [342] as universal hotspots, contributing −0.51 ± 0.09 kcal/mol per residue in Compound 7 but only −0.20 ± 0.09 kcal/mol in Compound 2. These findings resolve the ambiguity surrounding guava leaves’ anticoagulant vs. procoagulant effects, confirming their CFIXa-inhibitory potential. Compound 7 emerges as a promising scaffold for rational drug design, leveraging conserved interactions with the S2/S4 subsites.

Herein, we present the new SBYD31 benchmark set for BODIPY absorption energies and assess 28 different TD-DFT methods, most of which have not been tested on BODIPY dyes before. We show how functionals belonging to the class of recently developed spin-scaled double hybrids with long-range correction (J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2021,17, 5165) overcome the overestimation problem and provide more robust results that have met the chemical accuracy threshold of 0.1 eV. To our knowledge, these are the most accurate absorption energies for BODIPY dyes reported for TD-DFT methods. In passing, we also point out how previous recommendations of ""DSD"" double hybrids (RSC. Adv., 2022, 12, 1704; Comput. Theor.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-t65dj-v2,Accurate calculation of electron paramagnetic resonance parameters for molybdenum compounds,"Paramagnetic molybdenum compounds are of great interest in inorganic chemistry and metalloenzyme catalysis. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies that determine hyperfine coupling constants and g-tensor values are essential tools for investigating the local and global electronic structure of these compounds. Such studies require support from accurate quantum chemical approaches to establish reliable structure–spectroscopy correlations. Here we present a curated database of 22 molecular Mo complexes with well-defined structures and EPR parameters and investigate quantum chemical approaches to determine optimal protocols for computing 95Mo hyperfine coupling constants (HFCs) and g values of Mo(V) compounds. It is shown that the SARC all-electron basis sets developed for the Douglas–Kroll–Hess (DKH) Hamiltonian can be used without any adaptation also for the exact-2-component (X2C) Hamiltonian and require no modifications to produce excellent and converged results for both HFCs and g values. The dependence of EPR parameters on the functional is studied in detail. Double-hybrid functionals and global hybrids with high percentage of exact exchange are top performers for 95Mo HFCs, with PBE0-DH achieving the best agreement with experiment. The DFT results on HFCs are compared with values obtained by coupled cluster theory with the domain-based local pair natural orbital approach (DLPNO-CCSD) and we show that the latter falls short in terms of accuracy and consistency compared to the best performing functionals for the designated set of compounds. Smaller differentiation among functionals is observed for the calculation of g-tensors, with double hybrids being surpassed by several global and range-separated hybrid functionals, although PBE0-DH is still a top performer and can thus be recommended as the most reliable DFT approach overall for describing both valence and core properties of Mo compounds.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Spectroscopy (Inorg.); Theory - Computational,2025-05-07T08:33:06.218Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Material', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6818921a927d1c2e660f3b5b/original/supplementary-material.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/68189199927d1c2e660f2e24/original/accurate-calculation-of-electron-paramagnetic-resonance-parameters-for-molybdenum-compounds.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1n3d4,Polynomial Scaling Localized Active Space  Unitary Selective Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles,"We present a polynomial-scaling algorithm for the localized active space unitary selective coupled cluster singles and doubles (LAS-USCCSD) method. In this approach, cluster excitations are selected based on a threshold $\mathnormal{\epsilon}$ determined by the absolute gradients of the LAS-UCCSD energy with respect to cluster amplitudes. Using the generalized Wick's theorem for multireference wave functions, we derive the gradient expression as a polynomial function of 1-, 2-, and 3-body reduced density matrices and 1- and 2-electron integrals, valid for any multireference wave function.   The resulting gradient implementation exhibits a memory scaling of $\mathcal{O}(N^6)$.    The variational quantum eigensolver is used to optimize the selected cluster excitations on a quantum simulator.   By plotting the energy error, defined as the difference between the LAS-USCCSD and corresponding CASCI energies, against the inverse cluster amplitude selection threshold ($\mathnormal{\epsilon}^{-1}$) for polyene chains containing 2 to 5 $\pi$-bond units, we establish a relationship between the energy error and the threshold.   To further validate the accuracy of LAS-USCCSD, we computed the cis–trans isomerization energy of stilbene (a 20-qubit system) and the magnetic coupling constant of the tris-hydroxo-bridged chromium dimer \ce{[Cr_2(OH)_3(NH_3)_6]^{3+}} (evaluated as both 12- and 20-qubit systems) using the Qiskit-Qulacs simulator. Assessing such examples is important to determine the practical feasibility of quantum simulations for chemically realistic systems. Toward this goal, with this LAS-USCCSD algorithm we estimated the quantum resources required for simulating an active space of (30e,22o) in \ce{[Cr_2(OH)_3(NH_3)_6]^{3+}}, a size that remains beyond the reach of current quantum simulators for accurate treatment.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Quantum Computing,2025-05-07T07:09:52.179Z,[],https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6816779ee561f77ed4edb15d/original/polynomial-scaling-localized-active-space-unitary-selective-coupled-cluster-singles-and-doubles.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zfvnh,Computing L- and M-edge spectra using the DFT/CIS method with spin-orbit coupling,"Modeling L- and M-edge spectra at x-ray and extreme ultraviolet wavelengths requires consideration of spin-orbit splitting within the 2p and 3p orbital manifolds.   We introduce a low-cost tool to compute core-level spectra that combines a spin-orbit mean-field description of the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian with nonrelativistic excited states computed using the semi-empirical density-functional theory/configuration-interaction singles (DFT/CIS) approach.   The latter was previously introduced for  K-edge spectra and includes a semi-empirical correction to the core orbital energies, significantly reducing the ad hoc shifts that are typically required when time-dependent (TD-)DFT is applied to core-level excitations.  In combination with the core/valence separation approximation and spin-orbit couplings, the DFT/CIS method affords semiquantitative L- and M-edge spectra at TD-DFT cost, as demonstrated here for a variety of 3d transition metal systems and main-group compounds.  The use of different active orbital spaces to make spectral assignments is also discussed.

10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-33ljh,"Understanding the origin of stereoselectivity in the photochemical denitrogenation of 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptene and its derivatives with non-adiabatic molecular dynamics","Photochemical denitrogenation reactions of bicyclic azoalkanes produce strained bicyclic compounds of interest to synthetic organic chemists. We report a computational study on the mechanism of diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptenes to address long standing mechanistic questions. Indeed, the mechanism of these reactions have been disputed for over six decades. We employed non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations combined with state-of-the-art multireference quantum mechanical calculations to understand the photophysical properties and mechanisms of these diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptenes. The energetically accessible lowest excitations are nNN(σCN) → π* and range from 3.94 – 3.97 eV. From the >292 trajectories, the reaction proceeds through a dynamically concerted but asynchronous denitrogenation reactions. One σCN bond breaks along the S1-surface; the other σCN breaks after hopping to the S0. We identified two clusters of S₁/S₀ surface hopping points from these trajectories. In the first cluster, the methylene bridge is fully inverted relative to the reactant geometry. In the second cluster, the inversion is only partial, with one of the carbon atoms in the methylene bridge inverted relative to the reactant. We identified each cluster's corresponding minimum energy conical intersection (MECI), indicating at least two possible S1/S0-MECIs.  Our dynamics simulations illustrate that inversion begins in the excited state immediately after the first σCN bond breaks. This inversion is driven by the atomic momenta acquired after the bond breaks. These dynamical effects promote the formation of the inverted housane, thereby explaining the observed selectivities. A minority of trajectories undergo thermal conversion in the ground state, producing the minor retained housane product from inverted housane.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Photochemistry (Org.); Theory - Computational,2025-05-06T07:49:25.439Z,"[{'title': 'Supporting Information', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6813ca4d927d1c2e6694bfb5/original/supporting-information.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6813c7efe561f77ed4a38c0a/original/understanding-the-origin-of-stereoselectivity-in-the-photochemical-denitrogenation-of-2-3-diazabicyclo-2-2-1-heptene-and-its-derivatives-with-non-adiabatic-molecular-dynamics.pdf
10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-f1hgn-v3,A Foundation Model for Accurate Atomistic Simulations in Drug Design,"Neural network potentials now offer robust alternatives to electronic structure and empirical force fields computations for the on-the-fly production of the potential energy surfaces required in atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. However, widespread application in Chemistry and Biology faces several challenges: the need for fast inference and economical training; stringent model transferability requirements, particularly including charged-species interactions. Trained exclusively on synthetic quantum chemistry data, FeNNix-Bio1 sets a new standard for Foundation machine learning Models to provide predictive condensed-phase MD simulations including quantum nuclear effects. Its full-range of capabilities is demonstrated by modelling: water properties, ions in solution, small molecules hydration free energies, complex folding free-energy landscapes, large-scale protein dynamics, protein-ligand binding, chemical reactions and by coupling it to protein structure prediction foundation models' outputs for further refinement. FeNNix-Bio1 is accurate and systematically improvable while limiting human parametrization efforts: it is likely to have a strong impact in Drug Design.",Theoretical and Computational Chemistry; Computational Chemistry and Modeling; Theory - Computational; Artificial Intelligence,2025-05-06T06:33:37.872Z,"[{'title': 'Supplementary Information for: A Foundation Model for Accurate Atomistic Simulations in Drug Design', 'assetLink': 'https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6814fea250018ac7c5240187/original/supplementary-information-for-a-foundation-model-for-accurate-atomistic-simulations-in-drug-design.pdf'}]",https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6814f81f927d1c2e66badeea/original/a-foundation-model-for-accurate-atomistic-simulations-in-drug-design.pdf
